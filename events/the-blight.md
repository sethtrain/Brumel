# The Blight

Slowly, over the past thirty or so years, a creeping tar-like substance which
gives off a low, smokey haze has invaded the formerly rich farmlands of
southeast Brumel, forcing many farmers out of their homes. This has caused
overcrowding in the northern cities and, coupled with lack of food, a fairly
desperate situation for northern rulers.

No one knows the cause of the blight, though many blame the Dwarves out of old
prejudice. It is even rumoured that the blight has crossed the Spine into the
western lands of Brumel.
