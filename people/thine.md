of her comes from her followers as she never leaves The Isle.

wishes for them to return, presumably to The Isle.


## "The Blight will take them all"

Thine caused, or claims to have caused, [The Blight](../events/the-blight.md).
According to her followers, long ago she made a pact with the gods of Earth and
Water and the Blight was the result. These same reports has her having some sort
of continual control over it. These same followers claim the Blight is meant as
an agent of both destruction and renewal.
