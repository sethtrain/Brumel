# Church of the God of Fire

The dominant religion of Brumel, _The Church_ has established a world-wide
network of priests that are allowed to traverse freely across disputed political
borders, providing a critical route on passing information...for a small
donation of course.

## The God of Fire

Once merely one god among four elemental gods, the God of Fire rose to dominance
in the early years following the Cataclysm.

## On the Cataclysm

The Church's teachings regarding [the Cataclysm](../events/the-cataclysm.md) are
simple. The Dwarven clans, through their wickedness and arrogance, sought to
build works of art more beautiful than heaven could make. For this, the God of
Fire smashed their lands with a hammer of fire, shattering the land and
displacing the dwarven clans. Anyone disagreeing with The Church's
interpretation of the Cataclysm is at best dangerously misinformed or at worst a
heretic and apostate.

## Symbology

As with any religion, the God of Fire has standard symbols which mark out the
faithful from the rest.

### The Hammer of Fire

Often depicted in verse and paintings, the hammer is a dread symbol of the god's
wrath against arrogant mortals.

### The Burning Wheel

A more benign symbol of the god, this five-spoked wheel is often worn as
pendants or other forms of jewelry among the faithful. In general, the wheel
symbolizes the god's love of craftsmanship and knowledge, though religious
scholars have written shelves full of scrolls analyzing every piece of this
symbol including the number of spokes and the angles between them.
