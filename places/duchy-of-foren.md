# Duchy of Foren

Ruled by his grace, [Duke Karloff](../people/duke-karloff.md), Foren is an old
seat of power in the northeast of Brumel. Formerly the seat of the _Barony of
Foren_, a long-extinct family line, the land and title of Duke is now granted to
the governors of the city of Foren and surrounding lands.

## The City of Foren

The city of Foren is the jewel of the Duchy. A bustling trade city full of
artisans, religious adherents, scholars, and entertainers. While the city guard
is ever watchful, there is also a steady underworld trade system as well.

### Noble District

A small, but opulent section of the city houses the majority of the nobility,
either on a permanent basis, or in the form of summer homes for far-traveling
nobles.

### Temple District

Foren is also home to one of the oldest, some say _the_ oldest temple dedicated
to the God of Fire in Brumel. In addition tot he temple itself, there is a large 
reliquary housing many historical and priceless artifacts, guarded by the chief
custodian, Mikel.

## The Surrounds

Traditionally known as _The Surrounds_, this ring of land around the city is
mostly given over to logging, farming, and animal husbandry, providing needed
raw resources to the city and enough surplus for trade.
